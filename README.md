## Demo

## Getting Started

Use [this template](https://github.com/alchemycodelab/react-half-baked-card-passer) to get started.

### Learning Objectives

- Use context hooks to share state between components
- Refactor an existing React application to use React Context

### Description

This application allows you to pass cards back and forth between users and a deck. Before starting this lab, take a good look at the different components and try to draw out the component hierarchy. You should have a good idea of what each component is doing and how it is interacting with the shared state. Once you have a good idea of the state, then refactor the application to instead use a GameContext object.

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| A component hierarchy drawing indicating which components need what state | 4      |
| GameContext.js properly exports shared state through context              | 2      |
| GameProvider added to index.js                                            | 2      |
| Components refactored to use GameContext.js instead of prop drilling      | 2      |
